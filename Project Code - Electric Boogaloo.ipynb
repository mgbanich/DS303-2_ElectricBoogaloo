    "1. Some of the columns that should have contained only numeric values, specifically <>, <>, and <> have special characters such as \\*, #, %. We'll remove these characters, and convert the datatype of these columns to numeric.\n",

    "2. Some of the columns have more than 60% missing values, and it is very difficult to impute their values, as the values seem to be missing at random with negligible association with other predictors. We'll remove such columns from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The column `number_of_bedrooms` has some unreasonably high values such as 15. As our data consist of single-family homes in Evanston, we suspect that any value greater than 5 may be incorrect. We'll replace all values that are greater than 5 with an estimate obtained using the $K$-nearest neighbor approach.\n",

    "4. The columns `house_price` has some unreasonably high values. We'll tag all values greater than 1 billion dollars as \"potentially incorrect observation\", to see if they distort our prediction / inference later on.\n",
